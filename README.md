# üå≥ Avalised‚Ñ¢ - The Self-Designing RAD IDE

**A revolutionary YAML-driven visual designer that builds itself**

Built by Steve Wallis & Claude (Anthropic) | October 2025

---

## üöÄ What Is This?

Avalised is a **Rapid Application Development (RAD) IDE** with a radical difference: **it designs itself**.

The entire user interface‚Äîmenus, toolbox, properties panel, canvas‚Äîis defined in a single YAML file (`designer-window.avml`). Change the YAML, run the parser, and the designer rebuilds itself with your changes.

**No code recompilation needed. No UI frameworks. Just pure AVML (Avalised Visual Markup Language).**

This is **meta-engineering**: a designer that recursively designs itself.

---

## ‚ú® Core Innovation: Soft-Coded Actions

Traditional RAD tools hardcode every menu click, button press, and event handler. **Avalised doesn't.**

Menu actions are defined entirely in AVML:

```yaml
- MenuItem: DemoDialogInfo
  Header: Info Dialog (Soft-Coded)
  Action: dialog.info
  ActionParams: title=Hello;message=No hardcoded handlers!
```

That's it. The `ActionExecutor` reads the action name and parameters from the database and executes accordingly. **No C# event handlers. No XAML bindings. Just YAML.**

**17 menu actions wired automatically on startup.**

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Avalised is a 3-component system:

### 1. **AVML Parser** (C# .NET)
- Reads `designer-window.avml` (YAML)
- Fuzzy-matches control types (auto-corrects `MenuItm` ‚Üí `MenuItem`)
- Generates SQLite database with UI tree + properties

**Location:** `~/Downloads/avalised-parser/`

### 2. **Renderer** (Avalonia C#)
- Reads SQLite database
- Recursively builds live Avalonia UI controls
- Wires up soft-coded actions via `ActionExecutor`

**Location:** `~/Downloads/avalised/`

### 3. **Runtime Database**
- SQLite database at `~/.config/Avalised/designer.db`
- Contains UI tree, properties, attached properties, and action definitions

- Run parser
- Designer updates itself

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Build & Run

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- Linux/macOS (tested on Ubuntu)

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Parse AVML to database
cd ~/Downloads/avalised-parser
dotnet run designer-window.avml ~/.config/Avalised/designer.db

# 2. Build renderer
cd ~/Downloads/avalised
dotnet build

# 3. Run designer
dotnet run
```

**That's it!** The designer window opens, fully functional.

## üìê AVML Example

Here's how simple UI definition becomes:

```yaml
Window: DesignerWindow
  Title: My App
  Width: 1400
  Height: 900
  
  Children:
    - DockPanel: MainLayout
      Children:
        - Menu: TopMenu
          DockPanel.Dock: Top
          
          Children:
            - MenuItem: FileOpen
              Header: _Open
              InputGesture: Ctrl+O
              Action: file.open
              ActionParams: title=Open File;filter=*.avml
```

**No XML. No code-behind. Just YAML.**

The parser handles:
- Fuzzy type matching
- Property validation
- Tree structure
- Attached properties (DockPanel.Dock, Grid.Row, etc.)

---

## üß† Why This Matters

### 1. **Language-Agnostic**
AVML is YAML. The renderer is C#. But the *concept* works in any language:
- Parse AVML in Python ‚Üí Render in tkinter
- Parse AVML in JavaScript ‚Üí Render in React
- Parse AVML in Rust ‚Üí Render in egui

**Universal UI definition language.**

### 2. **AI-Friendly**
LLMs excel at generating structured YAML. Avalised is built for AI-human collaboration:
- "Add a button here" ‚Üí LLM generates AVML
- Parse ‚Üí Instant UI update
- No code compilation barrier

### 3. **Recursive Self-Design**
The designer's own UI is defined in AVML. You can:
- Add menu items to the designer *using the designer*
- Modify the toolbox *from within the toolbox*
- The ultimate meta-tool

## üí° Philosophy

> "The best RAD tool is one that can design itself."

Avalised proves that **UI definition** and **UI rendering** can be completely separated. 

YAML in. Live UI out.

No magic. No frameworks. Just data-driven design.

**This is the future of rapid application development.**

        caption: "Built by Steve Wallis with Claude (Anthropic)\n\nWhat AI-human collaboration can achieve:\nThis complete RAD IDE built in 24 days.\n\nThis designer was built WITH ITSELF - the engine\nloading its own interface from visual-designer.yaml.\nThat's not just recursion, that's poetry.\n\nLanguage-agnostic. Bash today, Python tomorrow.\nCustom controls. Live preview. Patent applied for.\n\nFrom little acorns, mighty oaks grow. ðŸŒ³"
